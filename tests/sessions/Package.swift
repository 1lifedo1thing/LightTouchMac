// The emulator-backed checks: the app's session code driving real helpers and guests, headless and silent.
//
//     swift run --package-path tests/sessions sessions <check> ... (sessions --help)
//
// `sessions` builds or takes the helper, runs a driver, judges its events and exits 1 on any FAIL. The drivers stand
// in for the app: session-driver (DeviceSessionProcess, BootRecipe, DeviceServices and the guest agent, as the app's
// sessions run them) and helper-driver (DeviceLink straight to the helper: scripted input, the modem, the pump).
// SessionKit holds what can be judged without an emulator (frame references, the home verdict, the Setup walks'
// page logic); its tests run in the Unit plan.
