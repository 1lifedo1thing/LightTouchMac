// OfflineChecks: Swift Testing over code that lives in the app's executable targets (the app, the helper, the services
// worker), which no package exports. Each fixture target under Sources/ holds symlinks to the production files it
// tests, compiled whole, beside the stand-ins for what those files reach into (the hub classes, the C library);
// OfflineTests drives them. No window is ordered in, no emulator runs. The Unit test plan runs it.
