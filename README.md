# Light Touch

Built with use from agentic coding products.

Light Touch runs classic Apple devices on your Mac: the original iPhone and iPod touch through the
iPhone 4, iPod touch 4 and the first iPad, on the iPhone OS and iOS versions they shipped with. Each
device runs Apple's own firmware in an emulator, so it behaves like the real thing: the Home screen,
the built-in apps, App Store apps and games of the era, Wi-Fi, music and photos, and on the iPhones a
simulated cellular network for calls and texts.

## Download

Get the latest notarized build from [Releases](https://github.com/samhenrigold/LightTouchMac/releases),
unzip it, and move **Light Touch.app** to Applications.

- macOS 14.4 or later, on Apple silicon or Intel.
- Light Touch includes a ready-to-use iPod touch (2nd gen) on iOS 3.1.3. For every other device and
  version it downloads Apple's original firmware (from Apple, or from public archives for builds Apple
  no longer hosts), checks it against its published hash, and prepares the device on your Mac. You can
  also import an IPSW you already have.

Most builds are marked experimental: they boot and pass their checks, but haven't been through as much
use as the stable ones. Turn on **Show experimental** in the Add Device sheet to see them.

## Building from source

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The tests come in three tiers:

```sh
# no emulator: the packages' Swift Testing suites
xcodebuild test -workspace LightTouchMac.xcworkspace -scheme LightTouchMac -testPlan Unit
# emulator sessions, headless and silent, on a prepared device (sessions --help lists the checks)
swift run --package-path tests/sessions sessions single PREPARED_BASE
# a built app: signatures, bundle, closure and the built-in iPod's boot
TEST_RUNNER_LTM_RELEASE_APP="path/to/Light Touch.app" xcodebuild test -workspace LightTouchMac.xcworkspace \
    -scheme LightTouchMac -testPlan Release
```
