// swift-tools-version: 6.0
// One device's host services (installation_proxy, AFC, springboardservices, notification_proxy, lockdown reads).
// HostServiceWire: what the app and the services helper share (the typed request/event protocol, errors, paths).
// HostServiceClient: the app's side, which runs every operation in a LightTouchServices process per endpoint.
// The engine that calls libimobiledevice is the LightTouchServices target's own (LightTouchServices/Engine): it
// links the vendored C library, which a package can't see.
