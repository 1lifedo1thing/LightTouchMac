// Push instead of poll. iOS 3.1.3 already has notification_proxy, and it
// publishes application_installed / application_uninstalled — so the sidebar
// can be told the moment something changes on the device instead of asking
// every few seconds. The np symbols were loaded for exactly this and had gone
// unused; this is the consumer.
//
// Stock install/uninstall notifications refresh promptly. The inspector's
// existing service poll also reads the Home screen layout, for which these
// older SpringBoard versions publish no notification. The session itself runs in the services helper
// (LightTouchServices/Engine/NotificationEngine.swift); this is the app's watcher that keeps one open.
