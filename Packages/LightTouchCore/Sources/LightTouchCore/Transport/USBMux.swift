// comes up, so usbmuxd must be listening BEFORE the VM boots — hence this is
// started ahead of the QEMU thread and its address handed over (usb-tcp-addr).
// Both ends are Unix sockets in the per-user temporary directory, owner-only:
// no loopback port any local process could reach, and no free-port race.
//
// Spawned with swift-subprocess. The daemon is kept alive inside a detached
// task; cancelling that task makes Subprocess run its teardown (SIGTERM), which
// is the only way a leaked usbmuxd — one holding the client socket and breaking
// the next launch — is reliably avoided.
