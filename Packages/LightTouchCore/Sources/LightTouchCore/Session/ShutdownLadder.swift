// Stop, Force Stop and Shut Down.
//
// Stop is a hard halt (Sam, 2026-09-28), never a guest shutdown: a booting or wedged guest ignores those and left
// the window on "Powering off…". SIGTERM makes the helper pause the VM, which flushes storage, and quit QEMU
// (DeviceHost.halt); a helper still alive after the halt budget is killed. The guest's filesystems replay their
// journals on the next boot. The helper's exit is Stopped (BootWatch.helperDied).
//
// Shut Down: the guest powers itself off, as the slider does (qemu_ios_ui_shutdown: the guest agent's halt, or
// 1.x's power-off gesture), so its storage is left clean; the helper stays, powered off, as after the slider.
