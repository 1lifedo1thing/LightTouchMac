// The device's orientation: the quarter turns the user asks for, and auto-rotation with the guest.
//
// Open a landscape-only app and the emulated iPod swings to landscape by
// itself; press home and it swings back. The signal comes from the guest,
// because on 3.1.3 there is nowhere else it can come from: SpringBoard's
// -[SpringBoard noteUIOrientationChanged:display:] updates an ivar and calls
// GSEventRotateSimulator() in-process, and posts nothing. The three
// com.apple.springboard.*Orientation Darwin notifications that notification_proxy
// WOULD have relayed are posted from the accelerometer path — they describe
// how the device is being held, which is the thing we are faking anyway —
// and springboardservicesrelay on 3.1.3 answers only getIconState /
// setIconState / getIconPNGData, so libimobiledevice's
// sbservices_get_interface_orientation has nothing to talk to.
//
// The guest agent reads SpringBoardServices' SBGetUIOrientation MIG stub
// (7E18's ABI; other builds answer ENOSYS and the shell stays put).
//
// EDGES, NOT LEVELS, is the rule that keeps this from fighting the user.
// We rotate when the guest's orientation *changes*; we never correct the
// shell towards the guest's steady state. The home screen is portrait-only
// on 3.1.3, so a levels rule would undo a manual rotation the instant it was
// made — the user turns the device, the guest stays at 0, and we would turn
// it straight back. With edges, a manual rotation the guest declines to
// follow simply stands, and a manual rotation the guest DOES follow reports
// the orientation we already moved to, so it lands on a no-op. The user only
// loses their manual angle when the front app actually changes what it wants,
// which is the moment they asked us to follow.
