// LightTouchCore: the app's logic that needs no window: the device library and catalog, device records and boot
// pieces, the install and media pipelines, capture naming, the session's state machines and the input and zoom
// math. The app links it; LightTouchCoreTests (Swift Testing) is the Unit test plan's suite. Built like the app:
// MainActor by default with approachable concurrency.
