// swift-tools-version: 6.0
// The build's own tools (scripts/ltm-build runs them): scripts/vendor, the Mach-O closure check of the native builds
// (ReleaseChecks' MachOClosure), the universal merge of per-architecture native roots, and the pinned dependency
// sources (fetch, stage-git, note) with the native and static build records.
